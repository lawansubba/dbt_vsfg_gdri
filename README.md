### Global Deaf Research Institute (GDRI)

**Overview:**
GDRI empowers the international deaf community through data-driven advocacy. It conducts community needs assessments to highlight the challenges faced by deaf individuals and supports policy changes, job creation, and improved accessibility. The project involves close collaboration with local deaf organizations to ensure data collection is participatory and impactful.

**Project Brief:**
The first step involves systemic barrier research on social determinants of health, followed by providing actionable insights to policymakers and stakeholders. The pilot project in Nigeria used WHOQOL-BREF for quality of life assessment, surveying 225 deaf individuals across six regions.

**Key Dates:**
- Project Start: May 2, 1 PM PST

**Tools and Support:**
Participants can use any software for data visualization and are encouraged to include the VFSG logo on dashboards. Steve Wexler serves as a mentor for the project.

**Call to Action:**
Data disaggregated from general disability data is essential for advocating for deaf communities' healthcare and support needs.
